	  <h1>FAQ</h1>
	  <ul>
	  <li> Why music? </li>
	  Ebola often spreads through acts of love, humanity, and caring, such as people caring for their sick relatives and medical workers caring for their community. Through music, we can show our support of people affected by this inhuman virus.
	  <li> Why is the ebola outbreak so bad? </li>
	  The most heavily affected countries had very few doctors even before the outbreak. For example, Liberia had a total of fifty doctors in the entire country! Despite the brave efforts of these medical professionals, there simply were not enough medical staff in these countries to treat all of the ill patients. The affected countries need our help!
	  <li> How did people in affected countries get medical care before the outbreak if there were so few doctors? </li>
	  Often, they couldn't. Even before the outbreak, people in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone often died of very treatable conditions, like malaria and childbirth. These diseases are still affecting people in these countries, and with all of the hospitals overflowing with ebola patients, many people are dying of these preventable conditions.
